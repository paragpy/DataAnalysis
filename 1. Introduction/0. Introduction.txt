Here we learn the Python tools to work productively with data. The task required generally fall into a number of different broad groups:

1. Interacting with outside world
    > Reading and working with a variety of file format and databases.
    
2. Preparation
    > Cleaning, munging, combining, normalizing, reshaping, slicing and dicing, and transform data for analysis
    
3. Transformation
    > Apply mathematical and statistical operation to group of the data sets to derive new datasets. For example, aggregating a large table by group variables.
    
4. Modeling and computation
    > Connecting your data to statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or other computational tools
    
5. Presentation
    > Creating interactive or static graphical visualization or textual summarization
