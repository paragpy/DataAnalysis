I sincerely apologize for not meeting my committed office days.
Due to my wife’s pregnancy and us living alone in Bangalore, my office visits have been less frequent as I needed to stay home to care for her.
My wife has now entered her last month of pregnancy, and my paternity leave is scheduled to begin in three weeks. I kindly request your support during these remaining weeks.
I assure you that after returning from my leave, I will strictly follow the flexible working policy and meet all committed office days.
