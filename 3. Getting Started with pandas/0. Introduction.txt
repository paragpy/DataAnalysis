I sincerely apologize for not adhering to my flexible working commitments. I was not aware that my actions would lead to this escalation, and I take full responsibility for not meeting the required office days.
I would like to provide context while acknowledging that these circumstances do not excuse my failure to follow the established flexible working arrangement:
Since May, my project assignments and team structure have been unclear, which resulted in scattered work activities. This ambiguity significantly impacted my motivation to visit the office regularly. However, I recognize I should have communicated this challenge and sought guidance rather than allowing it to affect my compliance with the flexible working policy.
Over the past two months, since I started working with Hamsha, I have been coming to the office as needed. The primary reason for this “as needed” approach is that my wife is currently pregnant, and we live alone in Bangalore without family support. I have been prioritizing staying home to ensure she is not alone and to provide necessary care, while simultaneously maintaining my work responsibilities and deliverables.
I fully understand that these personal circumstances do not grant me permission to bypass the flexible working system. I acknowledge that I prioritized my personal situation without properly following the established process, even though my work output has remained unaffected.
My wife has now entered her final month of pregnancy, and I am scheduled to begin my paternity leave in approximately three weeks. I would like to request your guidance on whether I may continue working from home until I commence my block leave, with a commitment to strictly adhere to the flexible working policy upon my return.
I am open to discussing this matter further and would appreciate your advice on the best path forward. Please let me know a convenient time for us to have this conversation.
Thank you for your understanding and guidance.
